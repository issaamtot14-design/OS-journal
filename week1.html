  <h1>Week 1 – System Planning & Architecture</h1>

  <p>
    This week focused on planning the operating system deployment and defining the system architecture.
    The aim was to establish a clear baseline for the environment that will be used throughout the
    remaining weeks (security hardening, testing, optimisation, and auditing).
  </p>

  <h2>Key Activities</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>System architecture design (host + VirtualBox + VM)</li>
    <li>Distribution selection and justification</li>
    <li>Network configuration planning</li>
    <li>Initial system information gathering (baseline commands)</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Baseline Evidence</h2>
  <p>
    The following command outputs and diagram provide the baseline system identification, resource
    overview, and network addressing required for Week 1. These will be used as reference points for
    later weeks when changes are made to configuration and performance.
  </p>
